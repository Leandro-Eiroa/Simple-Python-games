# Simple-Python-games
This is a set of the first begginers projects i`ve made in python a long time ago. 

These are one of the many games and mini-projects i have embarked in at the beggining of my journey with python. 
All of them were developed following several tutorials from TechWithTim and were really helpful for understanding the basic logic and potential of python.
